# containers

benefits of containers
agility, scalability/high availability, cost optimization, portability.
Common use cases would be a CI/CD automation, autoscaling microservices architectures, containers as a service, and hybrid cloud architectures.

Containers are a way in which we can place and isolate data and applications in to a container that's able to move between places.

when to  you use containers? 

They're going to add cost. They're going to add complexity. And they're going to add some latency in development especially with your first and second tries at working with containers. 
Need when the ability to isolate applications for portability. The ability to isolate applications for performance as they exist in a cluster. The ability to simplify some development operations. 

However, if you're trying to get traditional operations systems moving to containers just for the fact that you like to move to containers, you may find that they're mismatched in some ways. And the application requirements really are not a good fit for containers. Keep in mind they do add cost and complexity. Thus, there should be a clear case

Great for automation, development and testing 

What is an advantage of Containers?
Multiple operating systems and package versions function without the mess of conflicts and mismatches.
Containers use a layered approach.
Docker is the leader of the Container ecosystem.

 Advantages 
 - a truly distributed application that leverages components in isolation. That's what containers are.
 They provide us with a truly distributed application that leverages components and they're isolated so they can operate on their own.
 - if your refactoring your application anyways, then moving to containers is a good way to go
 
 - Portability can be exceptional, obviously, with containers, Allows nonportable applications to be protable and move from cloud to cloud and platform to platform. And we've had this before with, certainly, Java and J2EE People want to write to portability, however, there is a trade off that you may be missing some of the native features by writing applications, in this case containers that are portable. However, in Docker they've mapped that to the various native capabilities of the runtime operating system that sits in the platform so it's able to take advantage of the native features of the runtime platform even though you're writing to a portable layer of extraction.
 
- access to data is a bit tricky in containers. We have to deal with different security parameters, different tool sets, things are typically new. There are not a lot of people out there who know how to design

Disadvantages 
THey cost more than just lift and shift . Its very complex in term of Devops, Alot of different factors need to sync and work together in order for it to work. Since its newer support isnt completely there. Althoug due to open source its getting better

just because you can put them in containers doesnt mean you should.
